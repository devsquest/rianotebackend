              To get started you need to do two things: (1) Assign your
              subscription to yourself and then (2) set up your signature line.
              Both of these can be done on the main DASHBOARD page, and should
              not take more than a minute.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Assigning subscription(s):</b> Sometimes people purchase subscriptions for others, so first we ask you to confirm who the user will be, for each subscription you purchase. Scroll down to the bottom of your DASHBOARD, and click the button to assign the subscription to yourself. (Or, if you want to assign the subscription to someone else, just enter their email address.) If you are managing a group subscription you can eventually assign all the slots to others, or assign one to yourself and the rest to other members of your group.</li>
                    <li><b>Signature line:</b> Then once you have assigned a subscription to yourself you can set up your signature line. This should include your name, plus if you wish you can add your degree(s), certifications, and/or the name of your clinic. It’s up to you. Once you have entered it, if you later want to change it you just need to send us a change-request message (from the main DASHBOARD page) and we’ll do it for you.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <b>Once you are set up</b> you can click the green button on the DASHBOARD main page to start your first note! There is a help menu if you need it, but you should be able to just click buttons and type things in – and watch your note appear at the right of your screen.

                Eventually you may want to explore the other tabs on the dashboard menu:
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>My Profile</b> lists the basic information associated with your account. This is where you can change your password if you would like. Also you can subscribe to receive (infrequent) email relating to Note Designer upgrades or related product information.</li>
                    <li><b>My Requests</b> shows any requests you’ve sent to us, such as a request to change your signature line or for a refund (note that refunds are available only during the first 30 days after purchasing your subscription).</li>
                    <li><b>My Orders</b> shows you information about your subscriptions, including a link to the relevant invoice. If you wish more detailed information you can use the button near the top of the main DASHBOARD page to get a link to your account with Fastspring, our online retail partner. Fastspring is a popular international platform for managing subscriptions for digital products such as Note Designer. They handle all the billing-related issues for your account (including securely managing your credit card information).</li>
                    <li><b>My Subscriptions</b> is where you can see detailed information about your subscription(s). This will be particularly useful to you if you manage multiple subscriptions for a clinic.</li>
                    <li><b>My Notifications</b> lists any notifications we have sent to you, for example when you set up your account or assign subscriptions to yourself or others.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Cancellation: We are confident that you will find Note Designer useful. That said, you may decide at some point that it is not what you need and you would like to cancel your subscription. If you started your subscription less than 30 days ago you can use the Refund button on your Dashboard. If it has been 30 days or more
